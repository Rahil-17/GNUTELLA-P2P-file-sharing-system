1. Program uses TCP protocol for connection.

2. For proper functioning of CRS; there are 2 data structures. One for handling operations on repo_file and other to store details of clients connected.

3. Data structure for Repo_file is
	unordered map< File_name, < Alias, Path > >

4. Data Structure for Client_info
	unordered map< Alias, string>
 Here string contains IP, client port and client download port.

5. There is also a log file which contains information about which client called which command with timestamp.

6.Client may not connect to server on first attempt, user need to re-execute the command again.

7.Client should start sending commands when the program ask user to "write command".

8.Commands like search,share,del and exec works fine.

9. exec works on server-client connections.
